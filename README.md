# PaintProgram

# Description
The program used Java programming language where we used the swing GUI due to its online available resources, and its easy building which was great for the limited time we had for the project.

Paint program which can draw the following figures:
- straight line
- square
- rectangle
- triangle
- circle

Also the program has included the following:
- selecting an object
- deselecting an object
- deleting an object
- resizing an object
- moving an object
- changing the color of an object<br>

where each feature used a certain margin color to enhance user experience<br>

Also we used stacks to offer the following extra features:
- undo
- redo

# Design Patterns
In order to write a clean code we used design patterns such as:
- Factory
- Decorator
- Proxy
- Singleton
- Model view controller
- Iterator design

# Further Implementations
Adding the free hand drawing feature, but we are still not sure how to do it
